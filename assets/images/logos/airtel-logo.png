**Note: This is a placeholder for the Airtel logo image file**

In a real implementation, this would be the actual Airtel logo PNG file.
For development purposes, you would:
1. Download the official Airtel logo from their brand guidelines
2. Resize to appropriate dimensions (e.g., 32x32px or 48x48px)
3. Save as PNG with transparent background
4. Replace this placeholder file

Airtel Brand Colors:
- Primary: #FF0000 (Red)
- Secondary: #FFFFFF (White)
