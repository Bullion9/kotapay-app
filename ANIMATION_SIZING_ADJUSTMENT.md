# Animation Sizing Adjustment - Final Fit

## Adjustment Summary
Modified the loading animation to ensure the KotaPay logo fits perfectly within the round background circle while maintaining the enhanced multi-layer design.

## Changes Made

### Size Adjustments
**Logo Size:**
- **Before**: 100% of container (extending beyond background)
- **After**: 70% of container (fits comfortably within background)

**Background Structure:**
- **Outer Glow Ring**: 120% (reduced from 130% for better proportion)
- **Middle Ring**: 100% (main container size)
- **Inner Background**: 85% (clean white circle for logo)
- **Logo**: 70% (fits perfectly within background)
- **Rotating Dots**: 110% (positioned around the main ring)

### Visual Hierarchy
```
Outer Glow (120%) → Middle Ring (100%) → Inner Circle (85%) → Logo (70%)
```
