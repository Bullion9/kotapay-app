# Enhanced Loading Animation Design

## Design Overview
Completely redesigned the KotaPay loading animation with modern, layered visual effects for a premium user experience.

## New Design Features

   - Subtle blue glow effect
   - Pulsing animation synchronized with logo
   - Creates depth and presence

2. **Middle Ring** (110% size)
   - Rotating border with gradient effect
   - Semi-transparent blue with border accent
   - Adds dynamic movement

3. **Inner Background Circle** (90% size)
   - Clean white background with shadow
   - Professional card-like appearance
   - Elevates the logo visually

4. **Rotating Corner Dots**
   - Four animated dots at corners
   - Rotating independently around the logo
   - Adds playful, modern touch

5. **Enhanced Logo** (100% size)

   - Smooth pulsing animation
   - Central focus with maximum visibility

### âš¡ Animation Improvements

#### Timing Enhancements
- **Rotation**: Slowed to 3000ms for elegant movement
- **Pulse**: Extended to 1200ms for smoother breathing effect
- **Scale Range**: Refined to 0.95-1.15 for subtle yet noticeable pulse

#### Easing Functions
- **Sine Easing**: Replaced linear easing with `Easing.inOut(Easing.sin)`
- **Natural Motion**: More organic, breathing-like animation
- **Professional Feel**: Eliminates mechanical, robotic movement
