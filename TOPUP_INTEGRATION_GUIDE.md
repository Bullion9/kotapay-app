# Top-Up Integration Complete âœ…

## What Was Enhanced

### 1. **Real Balance Integration**
- âœ… TopUpScreen now uses `useWallet` hook for real balance management
- âœ… Added `useAuth` hook for user context
- âœ… Integrated `WalletService` for balance updates

### 2. **Enhanced Transaction Processing**
- âœ… Added `processTopUpSuccess` method to WalletService
- âœ… Top-ups now create real transaction records in the database
- âœ… Balance is updated immediately after successful top-up
- âœ… Transactions are properly recorded with metadata

### 3. **Improved Notifications**
- âœ… Enhanced notification messages with actual amounts
- âœ… Better notification formatting: "â‚¦1,000 added to your wallet successfully"
- âœ… Notifications now include transaction references

### 4. **Automatic Navigation**
- âœ… Auto-navigation to Transaction History after successful top-up
- âœ… 2.5-second delay for success animation
- âœ… Users can immediately see their transaction in history

### 5. **Real-Time Balance Updates**
- âœ… Balance card reflects new balance immediately
- âœ… Uses `refreshBalance()` from useWallet hook
- âœ… Proper error handling with fallback to mock mode

## How It Works Now

### Current Flow:
1. **User enters amount and selects payment method**
2. **PIN verification (current mock process)**
3. **WalletService.processTopUpSuccess() called**:
   - Updates wallet balance in database
   - Creates transaction record
   - Sends notification
4. **Balance card updates automatically**
5. **Success animation plays**
6. **Auto-navigation to Transaction History**

## Testing the Integration

### Demo User Testing:
1. **Login with demo credentials**:
   - Email: `demo@kotapay.com`
   - Password: `DemoUser123!`

2. **Current balance**: â‚¦50,000

3. **Test top-up flow**:
   - Go to Wallet > Top Up
   - Enter amount (e.g., â‚¦5,000)
   - Select payment method
   - Enter PIN
   - Watch balance update in real-time

4. **Verify integration**:
   - âœ… Balance card shows new amount (â‚¦55,000)
   - âœ… Transaction appears in history
   - âœ… Notification sent
   - âœ… Auto-navigation works

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `src/screens/TopUpScreen.tsx` - Enhanced with real balance integration
- `src/services/WalletService.ts` - Added `processTopUpSuccess` method
- `src/hooks/useWallet.ts` - Already provides real balance functionality

### Key Features Added:
```typescript
// Real balance update
await WalletService.processTopUpSuccess(transactionRef, topUpAmount, {
  paymentMethod: selectedMethod?.name || 'Card',
  gateway: 'Mock Payment',
  currency: selectedCurrency.symbol
});

// Immediate balance refresh
await refreshBalance();

// Auto-navigation after success
setTimeout(() => {
  setShowSuccess(false);
  navigation.navigate('TransactionHistory' as never);
}, 2500);
```

## What Happens on Each Top-Up

### 1. **Database Updates**:
- New transaction record created with type: "credit"
- User balance updated in database
- Transaction includes metadata (payment method, gateway, etc.)

### 2. **UI Updates**:
- Balance card shows new amount immediately
- Success animation plays
- User navigated to transaction history

### 3. **Notifications**:
- Push notification sent with amount and success message
- Notification includes transaction reference
- Message format: "â‚¦X,XXX added to your wallet successfully"

### 4. **Transaction History**:
- New transaction appears in history list
- Shows as "CARD_TOP_UP" type
- Includes timestamp and reference number
- Can be used to generate receipts

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

### Real Payment Integration:
1. **Replace mock PIN flow with real Paystack integration**
2. **Add payment verification with Paystack webhooks**

4. **Add receipt generation after successful top-up**

### Enhanced Features:
