# Expo Notifications Warnings - Normal Behavior

## üìã **Current Warnings (Expected & Normal)**

The warnings you're seeing are **completely expected** when using expo-notifications in Expo Go:

```
WARN expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) 
functionality provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the 
release of SDK 53. Use a development build instead of Expo Go.

WARN `expo-notifications` functionality is not fully supported in Expo Go:
We recommend you instead use a development build to avoid limitations.

WARN Could not get Expo push token (expected in Expo Go): [Error: No "projectId" 
found. If "projectId" can't be inferred from the manifest (for instance, in bare 
workflow), you have to pass it in yourself
```

## ‚úÖ **What Still Works in Expo Go**

Our KotaPay notification system works perfectly with these limitations:

### **‚úÖ Local Notifications (What We Use)**
- Email notifications (üìß mail icon)
- Transaction notifications
- Sound and vibration
- Notification badges
- Permission handling
- Notification interaction handlers

### **‚úÖ Features Working:**
- Tap mail icon ‚Üí triggers email notification
- Notification Test Panel ‚Üí all notification types work
- "Test Notify" button on Home screen
- Notification permissions and settings

## ‚ùå **What Doesn't Work in Expo Go**

### **Remote Push Notifications:**
- Server-sent push notifications
- Background notification delivery
- Push notification tokens
- Advanced scheduling features

## üõ†Ô∏è **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Ignore Warnings (Recommended for Development)**
These warnings don't affect functionality. Our local notification system works perfectly.

### **Option 2: Development Build (For Production)**
For production apps that need remote push notifications:

```bash
# Create development build
npx expo install expo-dev-client
npx expo run:ios --device
npx expo run:android --device
```

### **Option 3: Suppress Warnings (Optional)**
If the warnings are distracting during development, they can be filtered in the console.
