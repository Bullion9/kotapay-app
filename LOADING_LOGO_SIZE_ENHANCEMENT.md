# Loading Logo Size Enhancement ✅

## Changes Made

### **LoadingIcon Component Enhancement**
**File**: `src/components/icons/LoadingIcon.tsx`

#### **Before:**
```tsx
padding: size * 0.1,        // 10% padding around logo
width: size * 0.8,          // Logo was 80% of container
height: size * 0.8,         // Logo was 80% of container
```

#### **After:**
```tsx
padding: size * 0.05,       // 5% padding around logo (reduced)
width: size * 0.9,          // Logo is now 90% of container (increased)
height: size * 0.9,         // Logo is now 90% of container (increased)
```

## Visual Impact

### **Size Comparison:**
- **Background Circle**: Remains the same size
- **Logo Size**: Increased from 80% to 90% of container (12.5% larger)
- **Padding**: Reduced from 10% to 5% (50% less space around logo)
- **Overall Effect**: Logo appears significantly larger and more prominent

### **Where You'll See the Changes:**
1. **Login Loading Animation** - Bigger logo during sign-in process
2. **All LoadingOverlay components** - Bigger logos in loading states
3. **LoadingSpinner components** - Bigger logos throughout the app
4. **Any loading state** that uses the LoadingIcon with KotaPay logo

## Technical Details

### **Size Calculations (for 60px container):**
- **Before**: 
  - Padding: 6px (10% of 60px)
  - Logo: 48px × 48px (80% of 60px)
  
- **After**:
  - Padding: 3px (5% of 60px) 
  - Logo: 54px × 54px (90% of 60px)
  
- **Result**: Logo is 6px larger in each dimension, appearing ~12.5% bigger

### **Maintained Features:**
- ✅ **Animation Quality**: All animations preserved
- ✅ **Performance**: No impact on performance
- ✅ **Responsiveness**: Scales with different container sizes
- ✅ **Visual Balance**: Still looks proportional and professional

## Testing

### **How to Test:**
1. **Trigger any loading state** (login, transactions, etc.)
2. **Compare logo size** - should appear noticeably larger
3. **Check animations** - logo should still pulse and rotate smoothly
4. **Verify proportions** - logo should fill more of the circular background

### **Expected Result:**
- More prominent, eye-catching loading logo
- Better visual hierarchy and brand visibility
- Maintained smooth animations and professional appearance

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Loading logos now appear bigger relative to their round backgrounds!
